This week we will be creating our very own talking chatbot. Use the links below to get started.

- [Project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/chatbot){:target="_blank"}
- [Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}

**Attention people who have already done this project**

If you have already done this project before then feel free to repeat it but this time I challenge you to spice up your chatbot by making it speak in a language of the user's choice. Use the Text to Speech and Translate extensions to add the necessary blocks.
