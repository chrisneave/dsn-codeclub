This week we will be coding our own space animation!

Use the links below to get started.

- [Project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lost-in-space){:target="_blank"}
- [Scratch Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/){:target="_blank"}

**Attention super coders!** Those who have completed this project before and would like to build their own creation must accept the following challenge:

> Build a fun and imaginative animation based on the theme of "By the sea".

Some ideas to get you started:

1. A music video (think "Baby Shark").
2. A rock pool story. A romantic tale of how a lonely starfish who, against all the odds, met their ideal crab soulmate!
3. A cartoon reminding people to take care of the beach when they visit, e.g. don't drop litter, don't forget the sunblock, etc.
4. An interactive guide explaining how plastic thrown into the sea is damaging beaches around the world.

It must be your creation. No cloning existing projects or faking it!
