This week we will be using Scratch to generate random geometric patterns using the pen tool.

- [Phrasebook](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/cd-intermediate-scratch-sushi){:target="_blank"}
- [Scratch Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/){:target="_blank"}

On page two of the project instructions the `clear` pen block is actually called `erase all` in the latest version of Scratch 3.

If your pen is stopping before the edge then you can try reducing the size of your sprite to 1 or 0. 5 was the smallest value I could set.
