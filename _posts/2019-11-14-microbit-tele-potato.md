This week we will be using the radio built into the Micro\:bit to play a game of pass the potato.

## Coding

1. Click on [this link to go to the Makecode homepage](https://makecode.microbit.org/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Scroll down the page until you see this image and click on it:

4. The browser will now load the Micro:bit Editor. The project instructions should be displayed to the right.

5. Read through and follow the instructions on the right of the editor.

## Playing the Game

Now find one or more other Micro:bits that are running the finished code and have someone start the game by pressing A+B. If you have the potato then shake your Micro:bit to get rid of it and pass it to another Micro:bit. If your Micro:bit displays the skull icon then unfortunately you were holding the potato when it exploded and you are now covered in starchy residue and flakes of potato skin!
